# Adding Collaborators

Being able to create your own repositories in the new org means you will now have administrative controls over those repos and will be able to decide who has access and at what level. 

To add individual collaborators or teams to your repository:

 - [Individual Collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/)
 - Teams are added in the same area of settings as individual collaborators. 

## Items to note [PLEASE READ]: 
 - At this time, VMware employees without a Pivotal Otka account can't access this GitHub org as full members and must be added to repos they need to access as Outside Contributors. Please see the article [requesting outside collaborators be added to the new org](adding-outside-collaborators.md).
 - At this time, we are not allowing members to add outside collaborators.  If you would like to know more information on why, or request that an outside collaborator be added please see the post about [requesting outside collaborators be added to the new org](adding-outside-collaborators.md).
 - By default, we are asking that the All-Pivotal team get read access (at minimum) to each repository.  We believe this will encourage an environment of stronger collaboration and sharing across the work Pivotal does.  __Please add the All-Pivotal team with read access to any repositories you can__. 
 - Because forks are not allowed, for an even more collaborative environment, allow contributions from All-Pivotal by granting the group _write_ access. Then add a branch protection rule to limit push access to the master branch to your team. [discussion](https://www.pivotalk.io/t/github-repo-access-recommendations/29942)
